Branch-and-bound style search, with metasearch built on top for single result per dimensions fold. Distance-order searching is intended to drive bounding behavior. Flat representation is intended to lower footprint and enable faster access. Symmetry breaking is not a priority at this time, so geometric representations may be redundant by dimensionality factor
